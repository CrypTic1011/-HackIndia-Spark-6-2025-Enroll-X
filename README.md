# 🔗 FactChain  
**Decentralized Knowledge Graph with AI-Powered Semantic Search**  
_HackIndia Spark 6 – 2025 | Team: Enroll-X_

FactChain is a decentralized platform that fuses blockchain, AI, and semantic knowledge graphs to create a trust-first system for fact storage, verification, and discovery. Built for resilience, transparency, and community governance, FactChain aims to reshape how knowledge is contributed, curated, and consumed.

---

## 🚀 Overview

FactChain empowers users to submit, search, and validate facts in a decentralized way. Contributions are stored permanently using IPFS and Ceramic, semantically linked in a browsable knowledge graph, and made searchable with GPT-4 powered AI.

Whether you're submitting a new fact, exploring interconnected concepts, or staking your reputation on truth—FactChain ensures credibility is transparent and community-owned.

## 🧩 Core Features

- 📤 **Submit Facts**  
  Add factual statements linked to topics and concepts.

- 🌐 **Semantic Knowledge Graph**  
  Facts are semantically interlinked, forming a browsable and meaningful knowledge web.

- 🔐 **Decentralized Storage**  
  Uses **IPFS** and **Ceramic** to ensure permanence and censorship resistance.

- 🧠 **AI Semantic Search**  
  GPT-4 powered search engine returns fact summaries and related concepts using natural language queries.

- 🎯 **Reputation Staking**  
  Contributors stake tokens when submitting/editing facts. Community feedback affects their reputation and token balance.

  Minimal, clean UI to read facts with references, links, and author info.

- 🕸️ **Graph Explorer Interface**  
  Explore the entire fact graph visually—navigate between connected facts and concepts.

- ✏️ **Edit Proposal System**  
  Users can propose edits to facts. Community reviews and votes on changes.

- 🧑‍⚖️ **DAO-Based Moderation**  
  Disputed facts and reports are resolved via decentralized governance.
