**Decentralized Knowledge Graph with AI-Powered Semantic Search**  
_HackIndia Spark 6 – 2025 | Team: Enroll-X

FactChain is a decentralized platform that fuses blockchain, AI, and semantic knowledge graphs to create a trust-first system for fact storage, verification, and discovery. Built for resilience, transparency, and community governance, FactChain aims to reshape how knowledge is contributed, curated, and consumed.

---

## 🚀 Overview

FactChain empowers users to submit, search, and validate facts in a decentralized way. Contributions are stored permanently using IPFS, semantically linked in a browsable knowledge graph, and made searchable with LLMs.

Whether you're submitting a new fact, exploring interconnected concepts, or staking your reputation on truth—FactChain ensures credibility is transparent and community-owned.
